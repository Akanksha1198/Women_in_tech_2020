# Women in Tech 
This analysis uses the 2020 survey data from StackOverflow to get a glimpse into where women are in the tech world. The following conditions were analysed:
1. Number of Women and Men coding before the age of 18 
2. Gender gaps based on ages
3. Efficiency of women in coding compared ot men 
4. Average professional coding experience between the genders
5. Educational Qualifications of the two genders 

### Conclusion and Inference 
Gender gap is still very prevalent in technology community. This may be due to women not having exposure to software in the early years. With an abundance of excellent learning resources via the internet, we expect a decline in gender gap in the upcoming years.
